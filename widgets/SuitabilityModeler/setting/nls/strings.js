    description1: "The Suitability Modeler helps you find the best location for an activity, predict susceptibility to risk, or identify where something is likely to occur. This widget allows you to combine and weight different layers so you can evaluate multiple factors at once.",

    description2: "The Suitability Modeler uses fast, web-based Weighted Raster Overlay to generate models from a service. You can start from a blank state of a Weight Raster Overlay (WRO) Service or a pre-configured WRO model. Choose layers, assign weights and adjust layer classification values to define your analysis. Then, run the modeler, visualize results, and optionally save the result as an item in your organization/portal.",
