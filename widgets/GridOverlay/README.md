# Grid Overlay
The U.S. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) is an alpha-numeric system, based upon the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and Universal Polar Stereographic map projections, for identifying positions. An MGRS coordinate consists of a zone designation, alphabetic 100,000-meter grid square designator, and numeric coordinates within the 100,000-meter grid square.
